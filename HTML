        <p>
            Our CSR works with alongside WSD and helps their organisation to expand their efforts throughout Mumbai. Our members aim to advertise these dogs around ASB as well as their homes to encourage and motivate more people to adopt from their shelter. Our members also do frequent visits to the shelter to play with/entertain the dogs as well as clean up the trash and garbage that may riddle the premisis.
